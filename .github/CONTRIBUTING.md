# Contributing

🎉🎉🎉 Thank you for contributing! 🎉🎉🎉

I greatly appreciate anyone taking the time to help make Typed.js better.

## Development

First, clone the repo onto your local machine.

```
git clone git@github.com:sims2001/flarejs.git
cd flarejs
```

Then, make sure you have all the development dependencies installed.

```
npm install
```

(note: you will need Node.js, `yarn`, and `gulp` installed globally on your system)

To get things going:

```
npm run dev
open index.html
```

There you will see a list of pre-made demos showing each feature of Flare.js in action.

**Comb through these demos carefully and insure all features are working as expected with your additions**
